# Lab | Problems with Machine Learning

## Introduction

When working with machine learning algorithms, we might face many different problems. The goal of this lab is for you to deal with the most commons ML problems.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to prepare a dataset for most scikit-learn algorithms.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
